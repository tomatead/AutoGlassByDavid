                    <span class="titulo2">What Is OEM Glass?</span>
                    <p>O.E.M. stands for Original Equipment Manufacture. This means that the glass meets the original specifications for safety and quality as the glass that it came with from the factory.</p>
                    <p>Windshields may look simple, but they are actually made from two pieces of glass that are bent in a very precise way. If the windshield does not meet the exact specifications of the manufacturer, it will not fit precisely in your car. The best way to assure exact fit is to use a windshield produced from a fixture engineered to manufacturer specifications. O.E.M. glass is your assurance that this has occurred.

                    <span class="titulo2">Ding In My Windshield</span>
                    <p><strong>I have a crack or ding in my windshield- is it really important that I fix it right away?</strong> Yes! It's important for two reasons:
</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>a.) If the ding is small it may be repairable. That means Auto Glass By David can "mend" the break without replacing your entire windshield. Repairing your windshield typically takes less than 30 minutes.<br>
Best of all, in most cases, your insurance company will waive the deductible on repair service, so it's free to you! But the longer you let the damage remain without having it fixed, the more dirt and debris will collect in the break; and the more the break will spread. If it gets too big, it's very likely that a replacement will be necessary.
</li>
                        <li>b. )The second reason to have a damaged windshield fixed is for your own safety. The windshield is more than just a "shield" from wind and road dirt, it's an important structural element of your car. It helps keep you and your passengers in the car in a front impact accident, and keeps your car's airbag in the optimum position so it can function as designed. If your windshield is weakened due to damage, it could be dangerous to you and your passengers in the event of an accident. Also, damaged glass may cause optical impediments when driving, particularly at night, which is a significant safety hazard.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <span class="titulo2">Is not Glass Just Glass?</span>
                    <p><strong>What's the difference between my windshield and the other glass in my car? Isn't glass just glass?</strong> No. There's a very important difference between your windshield and the rest of the glass in your car</p>
                    <p>Your windshield is made of LAMINATED SAFETY GLASS. What makes it unique is its special construction, designed to offer optimum safety in the event of a crash. LAMINATED SAFETY GLASS is made up of two pieces of glass, with a thin layer of vinyl sandwiched between them. The three pieces are laminated together by applying heat and pressure in as special oven called an autoclave.
When a small object strikes a piece of safety glass, often only the outer layer stuck breaks. This is what makes windshield rock chip repair possible.
</p>

                    <p>In a more severe impact, the glass "shatters” but usually does not fly apart. The broken pieces of glass generally adhere to the vinyl inner lining. LAMINATED SAFETY GLASS also acts as a barrier to objects moving inside the vehicle.
The side and rear windows are made of TEMPERED GLASS. As the name implies, the glass has been "tempered", i.e., put through a special process where it is heated, then rapidly cooled. This "tempering" process makes the glass many times stronger than un-tempered glass of the same thickness.</p>

                    <p>
Upon impact, TEMPERED GLASS is designed to disintegrate into small pieces of glass about the size of rock salt. There should be no large, jagged pieces of glass to injure the driver or passengers. However, the force necessary to break a piece of tempered glass is considerably more than an un-tempered piece.
</p>


                    <span class="titulo2">Auto Glass Windshield</span>
                    <p>Your front window is an exceedingly important component of your families car. You generally think of how it keeps the people inside the vehicle secure from outside objects. Have you ever contemplated the dangers with your cars windshield? Your motor vehicles windshield can be something pretty dangerous when there is even a slight break or crack in it. You may not suppose a little chip is worth patching up asap. Here is some info on why this is very incorrect.
</p>
                    <p>If you allow the crack or break sit there for long, it will likely get some sort of moisture inside it. Once the cars windshield becomes hot from the sun the water droplets will struggle to escape. There's only so much area for the water to go. Because of this it will allow the chip or fissure to become greater. Almost certainly this course of action will get repeated a few times before you decide to have it patched up. Why put off until the crack or chip so large that it is obstructing your view? 
</p>
                    

                    <span class="titulo2">Auto Glass Replacement </span>
                    <p>Having a mark in your vehicles windshield is a very big circumstance. In order to sustain your autos windshield from fracturing more or even rupturing completely, you might want to consider auto glass replacement. As a substitute of having the tiny chip or crack refurbished, you might possibly want to ponder having it completely redone. This is a great idea if the fracture is over 6 in. of the fragment is beyond the size of a quarter.
</p>
                    <p>At our company Auto Glass By David, we retain only great quality when we are doing auto glass replacement.

Once we have restored your front window, we recommend that you keep your truck roofed for eight hours. We do this to make certain that the gum is completely dried and has no prospect of not grasping your autos windshield on right.

                    <span class="titulo2">Windshield Safety Checklist</span>
                    <p>Why Should You be Concerned About Safety when getting your windshield replaced?
Today's windshield does more than keep the rain, wind and bugs out while providing good visibility... It is an engineered system performing critical functions in the design of your vehicle. 
</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Keeps passengers safe</li>
                        <li>Part of the airbag system</li>
                        <li>Provides roof-crush resistance</li>
                        <li>Prevents passenger ejection</li>
                        <li>Provides aesthetics and comfort</li>
                        <li>Contour shapes</li>
                        <li>Tinted and solar control glass</li>

                        <li>Large glass parts with precise, complex bends</li>
                    </ul>


                    <p>Getting a new windshield in your car can be as simple as making one phone call...
Just be sure the auto glass company you choose understands and follows the federal safety standards for auto glass installation.
</p>
                    <p>Auto Glass By David guarantees you of a safe and properly installed windshield because we follow those procedures and acknowledge them in our Windshield Checklist for your convenience.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Use Approved installation techniques</li>
                        <li>Use Proper Adhesives</li>
                        <li>Follow Cold weather installation guidelines</li>
                        <li>Adhere t- "Safe Drive-away" Times</li>
                    </ul>

                    <span class="titulo2">How Much Time Should I Allow For Windshield Replacement</span>
                    <p>We're about to make you very happy: You don't have to go anywhere. We'll come to you wherever you are-at home,  or at your work And the whole process shouldn't take more than an hour, though we highly recommend that you don't drive for 1 hour after the installation so that the urethane seal will have plenty of time to cure. Your technician will give you an estimated drive-away time based on weather conditions and materials used.</p>
                    

                    <span class="titulo2">OEM And OEE Glass</span>
                    <p>We manufacture and install OEM-equivalent, or OEE, auto glass. This means that it is essentially the same piece of glass that is installed at the time your vehicle is made, with the only difference being the windshield manufacturer. Our glass meets or exceeds all federal, industry and safety standards, and we engage in some of the most rigorous product testing in the industry.
</p>
                    

                    <span class="titulo2">Vehicle Structure</span>
                    <p>Have you noticed how much more glass today's cars use than those of 20 years ago? Automotive engineers are increasing the use of glass in the design and structure of new vehicles. In fact, the windshield in a car may account for as much as 27% of its structural integrity and can help prevent the roof from collapsing during a rollover.</p>
                        <p>
Additionally, your car's factory-installed glass is part of its crash management system and is designed to be used as a "backboard" to properly deploy the passenger side airbag. We all hope we will never need our windshields to perform these safety functions; however, the risks are real. A recent ABC 20/20 News segment documented the real-life risks associated with an improperly installed windshield.
</p>
                    

                    <span class="titulo2">In Shopping Around, I Received Quotes Lower Than Yours. Why?</span>
                    <p>Just as with other businesses, not all auto glass companies are the same. Sometimes our prices are the lowest and sometimes we are a little higher. In every case, we are very confident with the service and product we provide to our customers. As a result, we will make every effort to find a way to do your job and save you money. One thing we avoid is unrealistic (and unsafe) cut-rate offers. All materials have a cost. While it may be tempting to go with the cheapest glass company, ask yourself if you always go for the cheapest product when shopping. Did you buy the cheapest car possible? Did you buy the cheapest house on the market? Do you look for the cheapest physician when faced with an illness or injury?
</p>
                    <p>Quality does matter! By cutting corners, you run the risk of compromising the safety and the structural integrity of your vehicle. For example, if not installed correctly, during an accident, your windshield may not be able to support your vehicle's airbag -- basically rendering it non-functional! Cutting corners has become such a common practice in this business that several news programs, such as 20/20, have featured segments addressing this exact problem.
</p>
                    <p>Almost any business could save their customers money if they are willing to cut corners. However, cutting corners in this business is not a safe way to go. We will not compromise on the quality of service provided or the safety of our customers.
</p>

                    

                    <span class="titulo2">Does Auto Glass By David Use Original Manufactures Glass When Doing Replacements?</span>
                    <p>Yes! In order to retain the vehicle glass' strength and proper fit, we not only use original manufactured glass whenever possible , but we also use original adhesive as well. We also inspect each piece for optical clarity and quality. This way, we can assure that our customers receive only the finest glass replacement parts available. This is second in importance only to the quality of installation!
</p>
                   


                    <span class="titulo2">My Windshield Is Leaking. Can You Just Replace The Seal Or Pug The Leak?</span>
                    <p>We do fix leaking windshields installed by other companies. However, we suggest that you contact the glass company that provided the original service and attempt to have them take care of the problem at no cost first.
</p>
                    <p>If they cannot or will not remedy the situation, we will do what we can, but be advised that to do so may require extensive labor or even a new windshield. You may be surprised that we usually can't simply squirt in some sealant to patch up the leak. However, in order to create a proper bond we need to remove the leaking windshield in order to inspect the surface to determine what is causing the leak.
</p>
                    <p>There are a number of reasons why a windshield may leak -- the number one cause being rust -- a result of cutting corners and improper installation procedures by other glass companies. In addition, bad urethane placement, too little adhesive, uneven placement of urethane, lack of primers or any combination of these and other factors can also result in vehicle leaks. The bottom line is that the windshield needs to be properly inspected before a solution to the problem can be determined.
</p>

                    

                    <span class="titulo2">How Do I Know Your Installers Are Qualified?</span>
                    <p>Your auto glass installation technician must understand all technical aspects of auto glass replacement. They must be familiar with the proper tools and methods of windshield removal, preparation of the pinch weld, and the different adhesives available that will provide the strength to hold the windshield in your vehicle. They must also understand the proper methods to prevent leakage and/or rust around the pinch weld where the windshield will bond to the automobile. Our installers have years of experience and have installed hundreds of windshields. You can rest assured that your new windshield will be properly installed to the factory specifications.
</p>
                    

                    <span class="titulo2">Proper Auto Glass Installation
</span>
                    <p>Proper auto glass installation is the key to your safety! The passenger side airbag uses the windshield as a "backstop" in deployment. If the windshield doesn't hold, the airbag has nothing to brace itself against, and it pushes outside the vehicle instead of remaining inside the car to work the way it was designed. Thus, the windshield MUST withstand the force of the airbag and remain in place. Proper glass installation is imperative for this to occur! In addition, your car's windshield supports the vehicle's roof in the case of an accident that involves a roll-over.
</p>
                    <p><strong>Several factors contribute to a proper windshield installation: </strong></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Quality of the windshield</li>
                        <li>Quality of the urethane adhesive, primers and activators</li>
                        <li>Condition of the metal of the frame, the paint primer, and the body paint</li>
                        <li>Knowledge, experience, expertise and thoroughness of the technician
</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>OEM adhesive products are equally important to a safe windshield installation. Some of our competitors use low-grade urethanes that are not recommended by the vehicle's manufacturer.  Auto Glass By David uses a more expensive OEM urethane due to its reliability and strength to help ensure a quality and safe installation!</p>
