                <p>Are the lenses of your vehicle's headlights weathered? Are your headlights yellow, dull, cloudy, foggy, and/or scratched? When driving at night, are your headlight beams projecting as intensely as they should? Did you know that the density of the headlight beam is diminished when the headlight lens is weathered?</p>

                <p>Headlight restoration is a great way to renew the look of your car without spending a lot of money replacing parts. All lights have a UV protective coating on them. Over time, this UV coating deteriorates in the sun. It begins to yellow and turn foggy.</p>
                <p>Most people believe that the only way to change this is to have them replaced. Unfortunately, light assemblies are only sold as a whole and not just the lens piece by itself. These can cost anywhere from $200.00 to $500.00 per light!</p>
                <p>We are very experienced while taking pride in the refinishing of yellow, dim, faded, dull, scratched, hazy, dirty headlights.. We restore & remove scratches in brake-lights, tail-lights, blinkers and plastic headlight lenses. The services that we provide  restores these light fixtures and brightens them up to look like brand new. This is a great way to update the look of your car and save a lot of money!
